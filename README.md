## What is Webpack?
**Webpack** is a ***module bundler*** for modern JavaScript applications.

&nbsp;

Webpack basically (at the time of processing your application), 
**bundles all your modules** (which are individual functionalities) 
into a **small number** of modules - ***often*** only 1 - which then is loaded
by the browser.

It is highly configurable, but to get started we only need to 
understand the 4 basic concepts of it: 
1. ***entry***
2. ***output***
3. ***loader***
4. ***plugins***
